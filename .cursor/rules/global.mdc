Guidelines for working on this project:

- Adhere to test driven development bu always writing the failing test first
- Write the code you wish you had (eg pretend functions, interfaces etc already exist)
- Use a clean architecture where possible to enable easy testing
- Always use typescript
- Always use svelte 5 and the modern features
- Always use pnpm as the package manager
- Do NOT write explicit return types for functions (unless there is a VERY good reason)
- Do NOT add unit tests unless explicitly asked to
- The only project specific commands you are allowed to run are:
  - `pnpm check` to check for type errors
  - `pnpm format` to format the code
  - `pnpm lint` to lint the code
  - `pnpm test` to test your work
- Always use daisyui and raw tailwind css (tailwind v4 to be clear) unless there is something you need to do that tailwind doesn't support
- Be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Plans
- Make the plan extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for concision.
- At the end of each plan, write a list of unresolved questions to be answered.
